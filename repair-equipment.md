# Tools for repair

### Methodology 
 - I do not recommend items I have not used.
 - Items are ordered based on price.
### Soldering
#### I cannot recommend any soldering irons under $33.
- $33 - Hakko FX-901 Battery Powered Soldering Iron
- $40 - Pinecil v2 Soldering Iron
- $60 - Quecoo T12-956 - (do NOT get the KSGER brand) 
- $250 - Hakko FX-951 - One of the best stations money can buy.
- $500+ - Hakko FM-203 - Above but better, 2 ports.
### Desoldering
#### Desoldering pumps (manual)
- ~$6 - "Large desoldering pump" - Big, yellow and blue.
- $25 - ENGINEER SS-02 - Metal desoldering pump.
#### Desoldering Wick
- $6-12 - NTE SW02-XX - the XX is a 2 digit number for size.
#### Desoldering guns
Budget options all suck, get the Hakko FR-301.
#### Hot air stations
- $30 - 858D clone, get whatever's on sale. They're all from the same factory anyway.
- $300 - Quick 861DW - The standard for a reason.
### Test Equipment
#### Multimeters
- Honestly, there's too many in this category to mention. 
- Anything under $50, just get whatever
- Anything over that, [EEVBlog's rundown is the best resource.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3WGaiYF2sk)
#### Oscilloscope
- Under $150, get a used one.
- $350 - Rigol DS1202Z-E - One of the best entry level scopes.
#### Power supply
- $00.Free-$50 - Modify an ATX power supply.
- $80 - Tekpower TP3005T
